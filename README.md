## UniCalS
Backend version of UnitCalculator built with Java Servlet and PostgreSQL. I also enable its local history function by using cookies.
Now with my effort, users can easily define their customized units which can be shared with other users. This app is deployed on heroku and try it [here](http://zhiweijia.net/UnitCalculator/index.html). More interesting stuffs about me and my works are on my [personal website](http://zhiweijia.net).
